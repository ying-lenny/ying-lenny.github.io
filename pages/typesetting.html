    <h1>What is Typesetting?</h1>
    <q>
        Typesetting is the way that text is composed using individual types -
        the symbols, letters, and glyphs in digital systems. It's a crucial part of the world of 
        design that requires an understanding of fonts, corresponding font sizes, and line spacing.
